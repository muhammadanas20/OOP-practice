// Question 1: Short Conceptual Answers
// (10 Marks | Suggested Time: 15 mins)

// Constant Objects: If you declare a const object of a class (e.g., const Student s1;), which member functions can that object call? Why? 


// Hint: Think about the "read-only" nature of the object and the const keyword at the end of function signatures.

// Private Constructors: If a constructor is placed in the private section of a class, what is the immediate effect on object creation in main()? Mention one real-world use case for this.


// Hint: Consider "Singleton" patterns or preventing copies by making the copy constructor private.



// Static vs. Non-Static: Why can a static member function NOT access a non-static data member directly? 


// Hint: Static functions belong to the class itself, while non-static data belongs to specific instances (objects).

// Constructor vs. Setter: If we have a parameterized constructor that initializes all values, do we still need setters? Justify your answer.


// Hint: Constructors only run at the "birth" of an object. What happens if the data needs to change later?
